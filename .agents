# Tastytrade IVR Scanner - Agent Automation Configuration

## Project Agents

### tastytrade-developer
**Purpose**: Specialized agent for tastytrade SDK development tasks
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
**Responsibilities**:
- Implement tastytrade SDK integration
- Handle authentication and session management
- Develop market data retrieval functions
- Debug API-related issues
- Optimize API usage and rate limiting

**Usage**: Use this agent for any tastytrade-specific development tasks

### python-architect
**Purpose**: Python project structure and best practices
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
**Responsibilities**:
- Design project architecture
- Implement configuration management
- Create proper error handling patterns
- Ensure code quality and testing
- Manage dependencies and virtual environments

**Usage**: Use for overall Python project structure and architecture decisions

### data-processor
**Purpose**: Financial data processing and calculations
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash
**Responsibilities**:
- Implement IVR calculation algorithms
- Process market data efficiently
- Handle data validation and cleaning
- Optimize data processing performance
- Manage data caching strategies

**Usage**: Use for any data processing, calculations, or financial computations

### testing-specialist
**Purpose**: Testing and quality assurance
**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash
**Responsibilities**:
- Create unit tests for all modules
- Implement integration tests with tastytrade API
- Set up continuous testing workflows
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Error scenario testing

**Usage**: Use for all testing-related tasks and quality assurance

## Agent Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Agents
1. **Complex Multi-step Tasks**: Use agents for tasks requiring 3+ steps
2. **Specialized Knowledge**: Use domain-specific agents for their expertise
3. **Parallel Work**: Launch multiple agents for independent tasks
4. **Research Tasks**: Use agents to investigate and implement solutions

### Agent Selection Criteria
- **tastytrade-developer**: For SDK integration, API calls, authentication
- **python-architect**: For project structure, configuration, best practices
- **data-processor**: For calculations, data manipulation, financial logic
- **testing-specialist**: For testing, validation, quality assurance

### Parallel Agent Usage
```bash
# Example: Run multiple agents in parallel for different phases
/task "Implement authentication module" tastytrade-developer
/task "Set up project structure" python-architect
/task "Design IVR calculation logic" data-processor
```

## Project-Specific Commands

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run the scanner
python main.py --watchlist "My Watchlist" --threshold 25

# Development mode with verbose logging
python main.py --debug --watchlist "Test Watchlist"
```

### Common Agent Tasks
1. **Phase 1 Setup**: `tastytrade-developer` + `python-architect`
2. **Phase 2 Watchlists**: `tastytrade-developer`
3. **Phase 3 IVR Calculation**: `data-processor` + `tastytrade-developer`
4. **Phase 4 Integration**: `python-architect` + `testing-specialist`
5. **Phase 5 Enhancement**: All agents as needed

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Task Handoffs
- Each agent should document their work for the next agent
- Use clear commit messages and code comments
- Update PROJECT_PLAN.md progress as tasks complete
- Create detailed error logs for debugging

### Collaboration Guidelines
- Agents should not override each other's work without discussion
- Use git branches for experimental features
- Document API changes that affect other modules
- Maintain consistent coding standards across all agents

## Quality Standards

### Code Requirements
- All functions must have docstrings
- Error handling for all API calls
- Type hints for all function parameters
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Configuration validation

### Documentation Standards
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Document all configuration options
- Provide example usage for all features
- Maintain API documentation for custom functions

### Security Standards
- Never commit credentials or API keys
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Implement secure session handling
- Validate all user inputs
- Log security events appropriately
